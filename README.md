Time Travel the Keweenaw 

A webmap application that allows volunteers to transcribe old documents, classify features of old maps, and tag properties. Plus, Volunteers can contribute their own family histories or personal memories of their favorite Keweenaw places. The project is just getting started. http://www.keweenawhistory.com/
